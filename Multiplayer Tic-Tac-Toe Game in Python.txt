# Networked Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This project implements a simple networked Tic-Tac-Toe game using Python. It allows two players to play Tic-Tac-Toe over a local network connection.

## Features

- Play Tic-Tac-Toe against another player over a network
- Host a game or connect to an existing game
- Simple command-line interface
- Automatic win/loss/tie detection

## Files

- `main.py`: Contains the code for hosting a Tic-Tac-Toe game
- `main2.py`: Contains the code for connecting to a hosted Tic-Tac-Toe game

## How to Play

1. One player runs `main.py` to host the game:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```

2. The other player runs `main2.py` to connect to the hosted game:
   ```
   python main2.py
   ```

3. Players take turns entering their moves in the format "row,column" (e.g., "0,0" for the top-left corner)

4. The game continues until one player wins or the game ends in a tie

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Socket module (built-in)
- Threading module (built-in)

## Network Configuration

By default, the game is set up to run on `localhost` at port `9999`. To play over a network, modify the host address in both files to the appropriate IP address.

## Future Improvements

- Add a graphical user interface
- Implement error handling for network issues
- Allow players to choose their symbols
- Add an option for playing against an AI opponent
